\begin{abstract} The increasing demand for personalized applications has emphasized the need for adaptable and efficient next-word prediction systems. This project focuses on building and comparing neural networks based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architectures for next-word prediction, trained on customizable user data. By allowing users to input their own datasets, the models can be fine-tuned to specific linguistic patterns, improving prediction accuracy for personalized use cases. The goal is to analyze the performance of both architectures, evaluating factors such as prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and the ability to learn from user-specific data. The outcomes of this study will provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of LSTM and GRU models in customizable, user-driven environments.

\section*{Literature Review}Raffel, C., et al. (2019) introduces the T5 model, it compares the performance of Transformer-based models with LSTMs and GRUs for next-word prediction tasks. The study finds that while LSTMs and GRUs are less parameter-heavy, they remain strong contenders in specific contexts where compute resources are limited.

Tay, Y., et al. (2020) primarily focuses on Transformers, it compares Transformer-based architectures with LSTM and GRU for sequence-based tasks like next-word prediction. It demonstrates that while Transformers are state-of-the-art for large-scale datasets, LSTMs and GRUs remain competitive in terms of memory efficiency and performance for smaller datasets.

Wu, J., et al. (2020) explore character-level language models using both LSTM and GRU. They evaluate these models on the next-word prediction task, showing that GRU outperforms LSTM on certain benchmarks due to its simplified gating mechanism, while LSTM remains strong in cases with long-range dependencies.

Xu, Z., et al. (2020) proposes an attention-enhanced LSTM model for next-word prediction that adapts to contextual changes dynamically. The addition of attention mechanisms improves the LSTM's performance, particularly in complex sentences where multiple contextual elements influence the next word.

Kaliyar, R.K., et al. (2021) explores various deep learning models for next-word prediction, comparing LSTM, GRU, and Transformer-based models. It highlights the effectiveness of LSTMs in predicting the next word in sequential data and analyzes how GRUs, with their simpler architecture, often achieve comparable performance with faster training times.

Vaswani, A., et al. (2021) systematically compares the performance of LSTM, GRU, and Transformer models for various sequence-to-sequence tasks, including next-word prediction. The findings suggest that LSTM and GRU excel in scenarios where training data is limited or when low-latency predictions are needed.

Wang, H., et al. (2021) proposes modifications to the GRU gating structure to improve its effectiveness for next-word prediction tasks. The new gate structure allows for better retention of relevant information, outperforming traditional GRU and LSTM models in various language modeling benchmarks.

Yoon, S., et al. (2021) proposes a hybrid model that combines the strengths of LSTM's ability to handle long-term dependencies with the parallelization efficiency of Transformer models. For next-word prediction, the hybrid model significantly improves prediction accuracy, particularly in longer text sequences.

Chen, Y., et al. (2022) combine LSTM networks with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to improve next-word prediction, particularly in noisy data environments (e.g., social media text). The hybrid approach outperforms standalone LSTM and GRU models in this context.

Zhang, X., et al. (2022) proposes augmenting LSTM-based next-word prediction models with external memory mechanisms. The approach improves the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies, outperforming standard LSTMs in a variety of next-word prediction benchmarks.

Liu, B., et al. (2023) focuses on integrating dynamic attention mechanisms into GRU-based language models to enhance next-word prediction accuracy. The results indicate that attention-augmented GRUs achieve better performance on complex sentence structures compared to vanilla GRUs and LSTMs.

Sun, L., et al. (2023) focuses on the performance of LSTM and GRU models for next-word prediction in low-resource languages. The findings highlight the adaptability of both models to smaller datasets, where their compact architectures outperform more complex models like Transformers.
